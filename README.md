We will research the Gaussian approximation by Random Kitchen Sinks.
We will also compare in quality with LGBMClassifier both on fashion_mnist dataset and on the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)!
Open the .ipynb file and enjoy! 

PS: It's better to use you computer resources if you want to examine smth new in algorithm, change the settings of boosting or launch plotly figure.
